              <strong>Children’s Privacy</strong>

              <p>
                <a href="{% url 'index' %}">Rhixescans</a>  makes a reasonable effort to prevent someone who is underage to join as a member. <a href="{% url 'index' %}">Rhixescans</a>  also will not collect information and personal data from children under the age of 13. If there is someone under the age of 13 to become a member of <a href="{% url 'index' %}">Rhixescans</a> , we will close that child’s account and delete any information collected about the child. Notwithstanding the foregoing, <a href="{% url 'index' %}">Rhixescans</a>  may choose to retain some personal information such as the underage’s e-mail address as a means to prevent the child from re-registering at our website. Since April 2000, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) went into effect, and as result websites all over the world wide web had to change the standards to not collect any information from a child.
