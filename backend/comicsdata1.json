In order to survive, he lived in shadows, but he was chased down and killed because of his family's schemes. He was then granted a second chance—regression. Using his \"ability to absorb the memories of a weapon\" as a foundation, Lee Cheol would train and go down a path of struggle. Persistent competition and schemes regarding the right to inheritance, attacks from other races and monsters in dangerous, unexplored lands, and even local clashes related to his family's internal struggles... His growth would bring about these things, bringing hardship upon Lee Cheol. Life itself would be a struggle for Lee Cheol, and this is his destiny.

The otherworlders have more sophisticated technology and hunted down humans with combat robots and viral weapons, and the remaining humans battled on for 10 years just to survive. The main character, ‘Park Sung Hyun’, was the leader of the troops in Incheon, Bupyeong. Prior to the invasion of the Otherworlders, he used to be a part-timer at a convenience store like an ordinary person, but he became a strong warrior in the process of losing his family and battling to avenge them. In the midst of the attack against the Otherworlders' headquarters, Park Hyun Sung got trapped in a warp portal with the leader. When he woke up, he found himself in a fantasy world that reminded him of the medieval times in Europe, and his soul was trapped inside a weak blonde 15-year-old pretty boy’s body. Hyun Sung was surprised by the unfamiliar surroundings and his weak body and found out that he is occupying the body of Ian Albarren, and that his father is the lord of a land who owes a large debt to the great lord and faces a difficult time ruling over his land. Park Hyun Sung, who had been fighting against combat robots and viral weaponry from the Otherworlders who had advanced scientific technology, decides to get used to this fantasy world to fight against monsters with armor and swords.",

He possessed the body of a powerless noble living on the outskirts, and decided to live quietly, avoiding others' attention. On his first day inside the game, he gets involved with the final boss, also known as the vessel of the grey demon, \"Elnore Elinarize la Tristan.\" After their encounter, the protagonist gains two special rewards: \"Desperate Survival,\" which makes him stronger when his rate of survival decreases, and \"Deadly Charm,\" which charms those who have evil traits. Not only do these two skills get him entangled with the final boss, but they also get him entangled with other demon vessels. However, with the use of his skills, he calmly overcomes the challenges with his veteran expertise. But every time he overcomes a challenge, those with evil traits become interested in him... Finally, he received his end goal. \"Put this continent's fate on the line and charm all of them.\"",

In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life.
